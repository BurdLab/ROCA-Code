# Biogeochemistry and Genomics Matlab Code

This matlab code was developed primarily by Dr. Paul Wang with some input from Dr. Adrian Burd.
The code is for the evolution of a simple model that combines genomics with plankton biogeochemistry.
The model is described in the Biogeosciences Discussion manuscript [Wang et al., 2013](http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/bg-2012-636/).
